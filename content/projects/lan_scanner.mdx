# lan_scanner

![pub.dev badge](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/lan_scanner)
![GitHub build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/ivirtex/lan_scanner/Dart)

[Dart](https://dart.dev) / [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) package that allows discovering network devices in local network ([LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network)) via multi-threaded ICMP pings.

Note: This library is intended to be used on **[Class C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network#Classful_addressing_definition)** networks.

**Warning:**  
iOS platform is currently not supported.
This is due to a compatibility issue with the underlying ping library.  
Blocking factors:  
[Issue #1](https://github.com/point-source/dart_ping/issues/6)  
[Issue #2](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/37022)

## Getting Started

Add the package to your pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
lan_scanner: ^3.5.0
```

Import the library:

```dart
import 'package:lan_scanner/lan_scanner.dart';
```

Create an instance of the class and call
[`icmpScan()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/lan_scanner/latest/lan_scanner/LanScanner/icmpScan.html) on it:

```dart
final scanner = LanScanner();

final stream = scanner.icmpScan('192.168.0', progressCallback: (progress) {
    print('Progress: $progress');
});

stream.listen((HostModel device) {
    print("Found host: ${device.ip}");
});
```

If you don't know what is your subnet, you can use [network_info_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/network_info_plus) and then `ipToCSubnet()` function.

```dart
var wifiIP = await NetworkInfo().getWifiIP()

var subnet = ipToCSubnet(wifiIP);
```

**Warning:**  
In order to use this package in the release mode, you may need to add the `android.permission.INTERNET` to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
