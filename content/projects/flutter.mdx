I made several improvements to the Cupertino package, including:

- Implemented large title magnification on over scroll for the `CupertinoSliverNavigationBar` widget.
- Fixed bug where text color was not resolved in dark mode and added tests to prevent regressions.
- Added new animation curve to the public API and updated `CupertinoPageRoute` transition animation to match native SwiftUI.
